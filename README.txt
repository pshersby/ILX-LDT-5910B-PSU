I have included Gerbers, drill and a PDF BOM/schematic etc

These files have been uppdated to fix the problems identified in the youtube video https://youtu.be/elwUcfqSWdY?si=OPNGzgTsbFvfNiMa
Sorry that the original design files are Altium CircuitStudio so I have not included them.

I do recommend ugrading the voltage of the capacitors to 50V because they rely on the circuit loading to be in range.

e.g. 6800uF 50V EPCOS part B41231A6688M000 available from Digikey

The transforer  I used was a 30VA transforer from the One-4-All range, manufacturer part number 14A-30-515, and this is Digikey part 595-1828-ND
